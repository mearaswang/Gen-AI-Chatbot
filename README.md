# AI Chatbot in Patients Education

## The problem, the business

Patient education refers to the process of providing health-related information and instructions to patients to help them manage their health conditions and make informed decisions about their care. It aims to improve patients' understanding of their medical conditions, treatment options, and self-care practices, thereby promoting better health outcomes and enhancing the overall healthcare experience.

Effective patient education can lead to better adherence to treatment plans, improved self-management of chronic conditions, reduced hospital readmissions, and overall enhanced patient satisfaction and health outcomes.
